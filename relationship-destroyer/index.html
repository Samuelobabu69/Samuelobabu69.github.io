            This game can be played with 3+ players, but 5+ players is recommended. 
            Make sure y'all have perfect relationships to destroy. Sit in a circle. 
            Whoever wants to start (Player A) draws a question and reads it for himself.
            He will then have an option to "discard" or "answer" the question. If
            Player A for any reason can't of doesn't want to answer the question, he
            "discards" the question, without revealing the question or his answer to
            it to anyone and gives the phone to the next player on his left and the
            game continues clockwise. If Player A chooses to "answer" the question, he 
            chooses a person (Player B) that he thinks this question describes him the most.
            Player B now closes his eyes or turns around, and Player A now shows all players 
            his question, except player B. Now that everyone saw the question, Player A now 
            has to spin the wheel, which decides if Player B gets to see the question or not. 
            If the wheel rolls "Yes", Player B gets to see the question. If it rolls "No", 
            the question is discarded and noone can tell the question to Player B. Player A 
            then hands the phone to a player on his left and the game continues clockwise.
        </p>
        <p>Keep playing until everyone hates each other. :)</p>
        <p>This game is heavily inspired by Stir the Pot card game, with some modifications.</p>
